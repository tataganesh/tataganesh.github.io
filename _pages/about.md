I am a second year Masterâ€™s student in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta. I am pursuing my master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Nilanjan Ray](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~nray1/). Currently, I am working on efficient black-box approximation to improve performance of black-box OCR engines. Generally, I am interested in accelerating neural network training using sample selection, calibration in neural networks and Data-Centric AI. 

Previously, I worked as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Capillary Technologies. As part of the Instore Vision team at Capillary, I have worked on Computer Vision products for extracting useful insights about customers in an offline store, under the guidance of Subrat Panda and Sumandeep Banerjee. Before that, I was a Member Technical Staff at Stride.ai where I worked on Document Image processing techniques to extract metadata from PDF documents, and Optical Character Recognition for scanned documents, supervised by Pratheek Mahishi.
